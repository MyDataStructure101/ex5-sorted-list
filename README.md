# Sorted List and Sorted Array

## Instruction

```cplus
   // Test 2
    /*
    How can I use a for loop to validate each member is equals
    To ilustrate, I use the psedocode:
        I want to achieve this:
        for index in range size the test array
            if sortList[index] == sortArray[index]
                do nothing or display the value
            else
                break the loop and/or throw a warning 
    Guidance:
    + There is several way
    + One of them is to create a function in each class that will return a value at the according index 
        then compare them one by one.
    + Another one is either have a function that convert the sortedList into a 
        Sorted Array and compare them (or the other way arround) 
    + Another method is also using overload operator (Also require a convert) 
    + Note Each of the methods given required other helper-functions:

## Requirements:
The driver program for each programming project should begin with "header comments" containing:
```cplus
/**
Your name
Programming assignment number
A short description of the program
Course
The date
*/

/**
For example:
Programmer: TRUC HUYNH
Project number: 2
Project Desc: Quadratic Expression class
Course: COSC 2436 PF III Data Structures
Date:   01/12/2024
*/
```
**note:**
- Use a standard indentation convention in your code (see examples in textbook).
- Use meaningful variable names.
- **Do not use global variables.**
- **Your class methods should not contain any input or output operations. All input and output should be done in your driver.**

### Submission:
Project will automatically clone to your github account. Please clone to your work space and work on it. Make sure you push regularly to create good habit. Your code will automatically submit to my board when you push. I will grade by due date. Score will be release by end of semester.
